# Overriding since when the compat REST tests are run from the qa project, all of the module painless contexts are on the classpath and the
# number and thus placement in the array are different then when running directly from the lang-painless REST tests
"Action to list contexts":
  - do:
      scripts_painless_context: {}
  - match: { contexts.0: aggregation_selector}
  - match: { contexts.22: terms_set} # <-- changed
